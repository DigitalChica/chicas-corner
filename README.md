A little of this and that. Nothing in particular. Just stuff I find interesting and useful.

Hi There,
So a little bit about me. I just to dibble and dabble in fixing code, then I had my son. I my brain turned creative on me so I started to design and develop sites rather than fix code all darn day.  I am not getting back into coding and ethical hacking. I guess you can say I am trying to expand my internet footprint in different ways.
